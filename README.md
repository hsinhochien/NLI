# Argument Relation Detection and Classification
Given two sentences, the task is a three-class classification problem:
* Class 0: There is no detected relation between the two sentences.
* Class 1: There is a “Support” relation from sentence 1 to sentence 2.
* Class 2: There is an “Attack” relation from sentence 1 to sentence 2.
